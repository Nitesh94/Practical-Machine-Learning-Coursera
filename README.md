    Human Activity Recognition - HAR - has emerged as a key research area in the last years and is gaining increasing attention
by the pervasive computing research community (see picture below, that illustrates the increasing number of publications in HAR
with wearable accelerometers), especially for the development of context-aware systems. There are many potential applications for HAR,
like: elderly monitoring, life log systems for monitoring energy expenditure and for supporting weight-loss programs, and digital
assistants for weight lifting exercises.
    Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal
activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take
measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks.
One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it.
In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants.
They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available
from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).
